## Keynote Talk
### Pawel Pralat
#### Modularity Based Community Detection in Hypergraphs

Abstract: In this talk, we present a scalable community detection algorithm using hypergraph modularity function, h--Louvain. It is an adaptation of the classical Louvain algorithm in the context of hypergraphs. We observe that a direct application of the Louvain algorithm to optimize the hypergraph modularity function often fails to find meaningful communities. We propose a solution to this issue by adjusting the initial stage of the algorithm via carefully and dynamically tuned linear combination of the graph modularity function of the corresponding two-section graph and the desired hypergraph modularity function. The process is guided by Bayesian optimization of the hyper-parameters of the proposed procedure. Various experiments on synthetic as well as real-world networks are performed showing that this process yields improved results in various regimes.
